# Implementation Progress

This records completed increments, not a claim that the entire roadmap is done.

## Stage 0: Baseline and Auth Checks

- Added isolated regression tests and a CI test step (Node.js 24).
- Updated the CI production domain to `https://media-vault.app`.
- Preserved password whitespace instead of silently changing credentials.
- Initialized the Supabase Auth session before password updates and sign-out.
- Added local-only auth return paths and validated email OTP types.
- Released auth form loading states on transport failures; disabled mode changes
  during pending requests and made feedback accessible.
- Documented required token-hash email templates for the server-cookie flow.

Verification: automated tests, lint and production build are required for each
commit. Auth actions use mocked providers; no real signup emails, logins or vault
writes have been performed. The user requested automated checks only for now.
Live confirmation/recovery and two-account RLS checks remain unverified.

## Next Increments

1. Review existing dependency security advisories separately from feature work.
2. Correct AniList score format, preserve source notes and complete dates.
3. Prefer saved provider IDs when refreshing metadata.
4. Expand catalog search and add a dedicated Discover route.

Later roadmap stages (density, detail-page polish, lists, saved views, backup v2,
activity history, calendar and seasons/repeats) are not implemented by this entry.
No schema migration is included in the baseline increment.
